            <h1>Aymeric Laporte clarifies Barcelona comments, still open to offers</h1>

                    <ul class="imageGallery">
                      <li><a href="#img1" rel="modal:open"><img class="img-responsive pic" src="../images/laporte.jpg"></a></li>

            <p>Aymeric Laporte is one of the most highly rated center-backs on the planet, and many Barcelona fans were sad to read a few comments from the young Frenchman a few weeks ago. Since then, Laporte has clarified those comments, and he might be interested in joining the Blaugrana after all.
            </p>
            <p>
            In an interview with French media, the 21-year-old defender spoke about his constant link with a move away from Athletic Bilbao. The Barcelona rumor is never going away, and Paris Saint-Germain are now also being thrown into the list of potential landing spots for Laporte. According to the young prospect, he remains calm and focused on his current club, just waiting for the next move from an European giant.
            </p>
            <p>
            "For now, I’m at Athletic and focused on the season at hand. Barca are the best team in the world, but for now there is nothing concrete and no-one has spoken to me directly. I wait patiently.
            </p>
            <p>
            "The Barca rumour transpires in every transfer window. The latest rumours even talked of interest from PSG. Newspapers like to insist, but it’s nothing really.
            </p>
            <p>
            "As for possible contact with Barca, you have to ask my club because I’m under contract. Athletic have never mentioned any interest from Barca to me."
            </p>

            While it is true that Laporte hasn't been officially contacted by the Catalans yet, it is expected from the Treble winners to go hard after him in the summer transfer window. There will be money to spend, and important issues like sponsorships and player extensions have been resolved. Transfers will be the only thing the board will need to focus on in the next window, and they are interested in bringing Laporte in.
            </p>
            <p>
            If they do it, then Aymeric wouldn't say no. Thankfully. Hopefully.</p>
