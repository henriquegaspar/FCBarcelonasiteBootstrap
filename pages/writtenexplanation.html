     <div class="container">
        <section class="newstext">

                    </br>
                    <p>The responsive design added in all created pages with the container blocks solved some of the problems pointed out in the evaluations as the following: “Improve the way as elements are distributed on the page, add responsive design and content more well formatted” (ID 8). “The history blocks should have some container with consistent formatting” (ID 84). ”On the club history heading, I'd suggest making the test have a little bit more space from the edge of the browser so that it's easier to read” (ID 111).</p>
                    <p>
                    A standard dropdown with bootstrap will be added and edited appropriately in the customize section of the getbootstrap.com to solve the following problem: “Dropdowns are a little weird; the dropdowns block the parent text” (ID 84).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A new page called “About us” will be added to the site so the following comment will be attended: “You could also have a brief page for what is FC Barcelona for anyone new to the site who doesn't know” (ID 111). “try and make it somewhat more friendly to those who come across it who know nothing at all about FC Barcelona” (ID 219).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The image resolution was mentioned in most evaluations, so I intend to change it to another image that works well both to the desktop size and extra small screens (it is pretty hard to reach this goal, since it usually works well either for the small or big size even using a img-responsive class). Besides that, I intend to decrease the header image height from 600px to 400px. So, the following comments will be attended: “ I'd suggest making the header image slightly smaller (vertically) as it currently takes up a lot of the page” (ID 111); “Improve image resolution” (ID 143); “Images stretch on xs” (ID 199)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The “FC Barcelona” sentence present on the footer on the main page was not being useful, so I intend to remove it. The following evaluation will be considered: “the main page says FC Barcelona at the bottom and it just seems somewhat out of place given that it adds nothing to that “(ID 219)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I will change the navbar font kind since I have used a lot of the same. So, I will just add a font-family command to the menu class with the wished kind of font and I will attend the following comment: “explore different fonts” (ID 199)
                    </p>
